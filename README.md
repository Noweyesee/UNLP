# UNLP
 UNLP is a collaborative project to create a playful and absurd language. We're building a dictionary and grammar rules for a language that's intentionally nonsensical and fun to use. Our goal is to create a language that's unique, creative, and humorous. We're using GitHub to host the project and collaborate on its development.
