# UNLP
 UNLP is a collaborative project to create a playful and absurd language. We're building a dictionary and grammar rules for a language that's intentionally nonsensical and fun to use. Our goal is to create a language that's unique, creative, and humorous. We're using GitHub to host the project and collaborate on its development.
 "Snazzlefrazzing" should be used as a verb to describe the act of decorating something with excessive glitter, and "Snazzlefrazzled" should be used as an adjective to describe something that has been over-the-top decorated.
